# What-Is-A-Fat-Burner-
Fat burners (or thermogenics) are dietary supplements that contain herbal extracts and stimulants that use the process of thermogenesis to encourage weight loss.  Thermogenesis is where the core body temperature is increased, in turn giving a boost to the metabolic rate, helping the body to burn off unwanted fat and calories. Fat burners can help to kick-start this process even if you are not exercising which make them a very attractive option for people with a more sedentary lifestyle.  The Chinese herb ephedra (Ephedrine) used to be a common component in many natural fat burners but due to its harmful and unpleasant side effects was withdrawn from general sale. Today it is only available in cases of extreme obesity, under prescription and strict supervision by a doctor.
